  <h3>Crystallography Research</h3>
  <h4>Computational Research</h4>
  <p>Utilizes Linux for computational calculations to obtain an optimized VioC State III, L-Arg and Peroxysuccinate intermediate and to accurately predict UV-Vis spectra of the metalloenzyme VioC and monitor transitions.</p>
  <h4>Experimental Research</h4>
  <p>In many human pathogens, the prokaryotic-specific, zinc-dependent enzyme Guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP) cyclohydrolase-IB (GCYH-IB; encoded by the fole2 gene), a class of GCYH-I, is the only enzyme present to catalyze the first step of the folate pathway. This fact makes GCYH-IB a perfect target for antibiotics; we are studying dehydrocostus lactone (DHL) and β-lapachone. Previous structural and enzymatic studies on GCYH-IB from N. gonorrhoeae showed it is structurally distinct from GCYH-I. GCYH-IB is a bimodular, homotetrameric enzyme activated by various divalent cations, and its active site differs in the helical insertions and deletions near the interface. Our study aims to gain structures of the inhibitors bound to the enzyme’s active site to complement the experimental data collected by our collaborators with GCYH-IB from B. thailandensis. Previous inhibitors have been proposed and co-crystallized with GCYH-IB from N. gonorrhoeae, but our solution data for DHL and β-lapachone suggest the latter inhibitors are preferable. From our initial crystal screens and optimization trays, FolE2 is particular about its environmental condition for crystallization, yielding non-diffracting crystals in one or two conditions. Therefore, FolE2 was lysine methylated to improve the success rate of crystallization by widening the range of conditions FolE2 crystallized in. After modification, FolE2’s crystallization was more successful than previous attempts and was further optimized for crystal growth. This resulted in the crystal formation evolving from walnut-shaped crystals (less desirable) to rod-shaped and plate-shaped crystals (more desirable). These crystals were prepared and looped for x-ray crystallography at Sector 23 of the Advanced Photon Source at Argonne National Labs. Once the structures of the enzyme with the inhibitors DHL and β-lapachone are solved, the results will be published with the solution experiments, providing a new option to combat pathogens with this enzyme, and the first structure of GCYH-IB from B. thailandensis.</p>
